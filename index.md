## Reza Mirosanlou

I am a Ph. D candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Waterloo. My research is focused on real-time systems and memory architectures. Currently, I am working under supervision of Prof. Rodolfo Pellizzoni.

### A Short Biography

I was born in Sari, Iran. I received my B.Sc degree in Computer Engineering from University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran where I have been graduated with honor (first rank among all CE sudents). I received my master degree (M.Sc) from the Sharif University of Technology (SUT) in Computer Engineering.
