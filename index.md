## Reza Mirosanlou

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo (UW), advised by Professor Rodolfo Pellizzoni and co-advised by Professor Hiren Patel. I am interested in research problems that lie at the intersection of Real-time systems, Computer Architecture, and Memory Architecture. My current research focus is on high-performance frameworks for real-time embedded systems. Before the Ph.D program at UW, I have received my MSc from Sharif University of Technology in the area of Computer Architecture where I have worked with Professor Seyed Ghassem Miremadi (may his soul rest in peace).
